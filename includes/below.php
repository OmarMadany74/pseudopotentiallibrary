[Create an issue](https://github.com/QMCPACK/pseudopotentiallibrary/issues) for help with this or to discuss a contribution. 

## Roadmap

* 2018-04 Add newly developed 2nd and 3rd row ccECPs.
* Standardize naming of basis sets for different codes.
* Standardize available formats. Convert or create new formats where missing, e.g. GAMESS, Molpro, or UPF format with projectors for Quantum Espresso.

## News and Major Updates
* 2018-04-12 Added Trail-Needs CEPP (2015) and eCEPP (2017) potentials, basis sets, and orbitals.
* 2018-02-22 Add RRKJ and TM potentials for 3d elements.
* 2018-02-20 Initial public version with ccECPs.
